This directory contains the current set of funtional query
definition templates. They are derived from the functional query
definitions presented in Clause 2 of the TPC-H and TPC-R Benchmark 
Specifications and should allow the use of QGEN (see ../dbgen).  
The template for query nn is stored in nn.sql.

Refer to Clause 2.2 for the permissible use of these templates.
